      <h2>1. General</h2>
      <p>
        The app provides a secure and user-friendly platform for students and parents (guardians) to buy, sell, or exchange second-hand school supplies such as textbooks, backpacks, and uniforms. It helps families save money by making the acquisition and disposal of these often-costly items easier, promotes sustainability by giving products a second life, and fosters collaboration within the educational community.
