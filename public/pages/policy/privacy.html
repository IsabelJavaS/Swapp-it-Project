        <section class="policy-card">
            <h2 class="policy-card-title">1. General</h2>
            <div class="policy-card-underline"></div>
            <div class="policy-card-content">The app offers a platform for students and their families to engage in buying, selling, or exchanging second-hand school supplies such as textbooks, backpacks, and uniforms. The goal of the app is to help ease the financial burden of purchasing new school materials by offering a marketplace for used items. Here's a deeper look into the core benefits of the app:
•	Affordability: For families, school supplies can be an expensive investment, especially if students outgrow items quickly. By buying second-hand, families can save significant amounts of money.
•	Sustainability: Rather than discarding or letting items go to waste, the app encourages giving these products a second life. This contributes to environmental conservation by reducing waste and promoting re-use.
•	Community Collaboration: The platform promotes collaboration within the educational ecosystem, creating opportunities for students, parents, and guardians to support one another. It connects people within a shared community, fostering a sense of solidarity.</div>

        <section class="policy-card">
            <h2 class="policy-card-title">Privacy Policy (Summary)</h2>
            <div class="policy-card-underline"></div>
            <div class="policy-card-content">The app places a high priority on protecting user privacy. Here’s an overview of how they handle data:
•	Types of Data Collected:
o	Personal Information: The app collects essential details like name, email address, student ID, and face photographs (for identity verification or profile purposes). They also collect the school name to ensure that transactions are within the same educational context.
o	Device Information: This includes basic technical details such as IP address, browser type, and the operating system of the user's device. This information is typically used for improving functionality and ensuring compatibility across various devices.
•	Purpose of Data Collection:
o	Facilitating Transactions: The data collected is used to help users buy, sell, or exchange products on the platform.
o	Enhancing User Experience: Information is also used to optimize the user interface and platform experience.
o	Ensuring Safety: The platform uses data to monitor and protect against fraud and other security threats to ensure that all transactions are legitimate and safe.
•	Data Sharing Policy:
o	Limited Sharing: The platform doesn't share personal information with third parties unless required by law or to protect user security. This means users' data is kept confidential unless there's a legal obligation to disclose it.
o	Modifications: The app reserves the right to make changes to the privacy policy, and users will be informed of any significant updates.</div>

        <section class="policy-card">
            <h2 class="policy-card-title">Return Policy</h2>
            <div class="policy-card-underline"></div>
            <div class="policy-card-content">The return policy is clear, ensuring that users understand their rights and responsibilities when buying items through the app. Here's a deeper explanation of the policy:
•	Timeframe for Returns:
o	Any defects or issues with a purchased item must be reported within 72 hours of receiving the item. After this period, the app is no longer liable for return claims, so it’s important for users to inspect their purchases as soon as possible.
•	Valid Return Reasons:
 The app will accept returns for specific types of defects, such as:
o	Missing parts: This can include buttons, zippers, or other essential components of an item.
o	Water damage: If an item is damaged by water, it qualifies for a return.
o	Non-functioning electronics: If the electronic product does not turn on or function properly.
o	Missing pages in textbooks: If a book is incomplete and pages are missing.
o	Stains or Tears: In the case of clothing, if there are significant stains or rips.
If the product description already mentions any of these issues (e.g., minor stains or missing buttons), then by purchasing the item, the buyer acknowledges these imperfections and waives the right to return it for these specific issues.</div>
